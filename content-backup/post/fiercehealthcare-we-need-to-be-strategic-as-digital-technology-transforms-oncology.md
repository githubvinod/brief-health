title: We need to be strategic as digital technology transforms oncology
---
Both the oncology patient’s and his or her provider’s cancer care experience will be completely different a decade from now, driven, in large part, by the increased implementation of digital health technology both inside and outside of the treatment center.

Digital technologies that can monitor, collect and analyze patient data through the use of medical-grade wearables or facilitated patient reporting will expand the medical record, contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the patient and inform the care plan with data-driven treatment solutions.
