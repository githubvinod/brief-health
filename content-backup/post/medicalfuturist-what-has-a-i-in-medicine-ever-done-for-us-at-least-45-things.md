title: What Has A.I. In Medicine Ever Done For Us? At Least 45 Things!
---
Remember Monty Python’s brilliant Life of Brian movie scene where the Palestinian insurgent commando, planning the abduction of Pilate’s wife in return for all the horrors they had to endure from the Roman Empire, asks the rhetorical question: what have the Romans ever done for us? With the hype and overmarketing, not to speak about the fears around A.I, we asked the same question. What has A.I. in medicine ever done for us? Well, we found at least 45 things.

I have 45 responses to the pressing question on everyone’s mind who is interested in healthcare but tired of the hype or the doomsday scenarios around A.I.: what has this technology ever done for us?
