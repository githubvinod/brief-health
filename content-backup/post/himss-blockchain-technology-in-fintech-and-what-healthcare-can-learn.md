title: Blockchain Technology in Fintech and What Healthcare Can Learn
---
Like all emerging technology, blockchain is moving through a crawl, walk, run progression of its maturity and implementation across industries.

It is still in its infancy in many ways in healthcare, but crawling faster than most expected with many solutions entering production around a number of use cases. As we watch this technology evolve within the healthcare ecosystem, it is important to recognize its maturity and trajectory in other industries and, as appropriate, learn from their experiences toward blockchain technology regulation and adoption.

I recently attended a blockchain summit where innovators, technologists, policymakers and regulators came together to discuss the growing blockchain landscape. While we are seeing blockchain take root cross-industries, we focused heavily on its application to the financial technology space, also referred to as Fintech. In Fintech, blockchain was described as having matured into a “running toddler” by speaker Terry Culver with Digital Finance Group. Like a toddler, blockchain technology is not yet efficient or completely rational, may be volatile and has the policymakers and regulators trying to keep up as its adoption and use begin to grow.
