The number of connected medical devices being used in hospitals and healthcare organizations continues to grow at a rapid pace, representing a vulnerable surface for cyberattacks.

Raising the cyberrisks even further, 70% of devices in healthcare organizations will be running unsupported Windows operating systems by January 2020, according to a new cybersecurity report.

Microsoft support for devices running Windows 7, Windows 2008 or Windows Mobile is planned to expire by January 14, according to a cybersecurity report from Forescout, a medical device and internet of things (IoT) cybersecurity company. Running unsupported operating systems poses a risk that may expose vulnerabilities and has the potential to impact regulatory compliance.
