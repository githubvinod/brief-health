title: CHIME playbook seeks to optimize use of IT against opioids
---
The College of Healthcare Information Management Executives' opioid task force published a playbook to help senior health IT leaders combat opioid abuse through IT that offers resources and real-world examples of health care providers' IT-based efforts against the opioid epidemic. "Because the playbook is an electronic document, we can make revisions at any time to reflect the current state of the opioid epidemic," said Dave Lehr, task force co-chair and CIO at Maryland-based Anne Arundel Medical Center.
