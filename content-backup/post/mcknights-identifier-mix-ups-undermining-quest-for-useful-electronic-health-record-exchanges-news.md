Researchers who analyzed over 700 comments on the proposed interoperability rule found that issues related to patient matching, such as the lack of unique identifiers and patients sharing the same names and dates of birth, could hinder the exchange of EHRs, compromise care coordination and increase health care costs. "Today, there is no consistent approach to accurately matching a patient to their health information, which has led to significant costs to hospitals, health systems, physician practices, long-term post-acute care (LTPAC) facilities, and other providers," AHIMA CEO Wylecia Wiggs Harris wrote in her comment.
