In spite of common fears and perceived dangers, artificial intelligence won’t take the jobs of physicians and won’t monopolize medicine. On the contrary: as A.I. will help automate administrative tasks and take over monotonous day-to-day assignments, it will free up time for medical professionals to finally fulfill the mission they signed up for: to help people on their journeys to health with compassion, creativity, and care. Moreover, rather than wiping it out, A.I. will, in fact, facilitate the art of medicine. Let us show it through the example of the AlphaGo documentary.
