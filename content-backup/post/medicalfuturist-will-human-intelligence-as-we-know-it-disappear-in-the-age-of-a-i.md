title: Will Human Intelligence As We Know It Disappear In The Age Of A.I.?
---
Who is more intelligent: a caveman, a smartphone or your brother? What if we also put artificial intelligence in line? Humanity has come a long way from the African savannah to arrive at the urban skyscrapers, and not only physically, but also cognitively. Stone tools, speech, writing, pen, and paper all proved to be decisive tools in putting human intelligence on a path never seen before. What could happen with the emergence of A.I., in which case itâ€™s not about using an instrument anymore but to collaborate with a created, but responsive source of intelligence? Is humanity ready for it?
