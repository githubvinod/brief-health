title: 'EHRA: ONC Interoperability Proposed Rule Discourages Innovation'
---
The ONC's proposed interoperability and information blocking rule "would discourage innovation by imposing limitations on profit as well as compulsory licensing terms for new intellectual property, created through extensive investment in development," according to comments submitted by the EHR Association. The group also said the rule would create a regulatory burden that could stifle health IT innovation, adding that information blocking-related definitions are overly broad and that the suggested 24-month implementation timeline may not be possible.
