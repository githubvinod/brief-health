When it comes to building technology to improve the patient experience, many people think of wayfinding applications or other mobile tools. Those are useful, but there is also a major revolution going on in communications between doctors, hospitals, clinics, medical device companies and patients.

Modern technology has made it possible to radically improve physician-patient interactions.

It’s ironic that the word “patient” so perfectly describes the difficult experiences that we have in hospitals and clinics today. "Patient" comes from the Latin "patiens," which means to bear or to suffer. Part of the problem stems from the stark contrast between what is important to patients and what is important to caregivers.
