Greenway Health, a leading health information technology and services provider, has appointed Dr. Geeta Nayyar chief medical officer. Dr. Nayyar is a nationally recognized leader in health information technology as well as a practicing physician.

As chief medical officer, Dr. Nayyar brings the physician’s lens and voice to Greenway’s vision for driving innovation and collaboration in healthcare — especially as the company continues to deliver services and solutions that prepare practices for value-based care and the future of healthcare.    

Dr. Nayyar will be instrumental in guiding the development of Greenway’s next-generation EHR from a physician’s perspective. Greenway’s Intergy platform will evolve into the company’s state-of-the-art platform, now in development as Project Polaris, and will introduce technology that drives practice efficiencies to help physicians avoid burnout, reduce costs, and take advantage of new government payment models.

“Dr. Nayyar brings an expert’s perspective — bridging clinical medicine, information technology and business to really understand the challenges providers face in an evolving healthcare system,” said Richard Atkin, CEO of Greenway Health. “As a company and trusted adviser to our customers, Greenway values the physician perspective. Dr. Nayyar will join us in helping physicians and healthcare providers drive and adapt to change, whether that means succeeding in value-based care, improving patient outcomes, or aligning the clinical perspective to a practice’s unique vision and strategy.”

Dr. Nayyar was named among “Top 26 Smartest People in Health IT” by Becker's Hospital Review and ranked one of the “Top 25 Minority Executives in Healthcare” by Modern Healthcare. She is the author of the mobile health chapter in the HIMSS Medical Informatics textbook and a noted social media expert and blogger for The Huffington Post. In addition, MedCity News recognized Dr. Nayyar as one of 12 women who are “powerful voices in healthcare innovation and on Twitter.”

Previously, Dr. Nayyar was chief medical information officer at AT&T, where she provided subject matter expertise, thought leadership, and strategic direction. Also, she served as a member of the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Board of Directors.

Most recently, Dr. Nayyar served as chief healthcare and innovation officer at Femwell Group Health, one of the largest management services organizations in Florida. During her tenure, she was instrumental in creating and launching innovations around physician and patient engagement technologies. She also established the company in the digital media and marketing space, hosting its medical YouTube channel “Topline MD TV.”
