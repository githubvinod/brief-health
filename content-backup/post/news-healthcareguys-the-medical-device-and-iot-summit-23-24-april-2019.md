SUMMIT CHAIRPERSON Tim Gee, Principal, Medical Connectivity Consulting CHAIRPERSONS NOTE Since the advent of the HITECH Act in 2009, EMRs have gone from a growth to a replacement market.

In this new environment, the connectivity focus has shifted from clinical documentation of medical device data into the patients chart, to capturing and consuming device data in a myriad of ways.
