title: '3D body scans and AI health records: Inside the doctorâ€™s office of the future'
---
The primary care office of the future has only a few chairs in the waiting room; patients check themselves in on tablet computers; a 3D body scanner gathers biometric data, which is then analyzed by artificial intelligence; the patient and health care provider review the information together on a large touchscreen; and patients get an app for storing their own health data. The concept is a reality at Forward Health offices, which charges a monthly subscription fee that can be paid using a flexible spending account or health savings account.
