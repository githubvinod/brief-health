title: Optimizing EMRs To Lessen Administrative Burdens
---
Despite the current emphasis on streamlining healthcare delivery, the administrative burdens placed on today’s healthcare providers—physicians, nurses, medical assistants and office staff—are heavier than they have ever been. Between managing diverse information coming into the organization, ensuring it ends up in the right place within the electronic medical record (EMR), correctly capturing every element of a patient encounter, and accurately coding it to support proactive and comprehensive care, providers have a lot of non-clinical tasks on their plates. Amid these competing priorities, they are also expected to deliver a consistent, compassionate patient experience and smoothly handle unexpected situations.
