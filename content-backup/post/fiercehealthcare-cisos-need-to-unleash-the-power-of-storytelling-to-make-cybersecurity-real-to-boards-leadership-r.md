Healthcare organizations, particularly healthcare providers, are in the crosshairs of cybercriminals due to the value of healthcare data and the large attack surface represented by hospital IT systems and connected medical devices.

According to Protenus, the number of patient records impacted has nearly tripled in just one year, jumping from 5.5 million breached records in 2017 to about 15 million in 2018. One look at the headlines, including news of a major flaw in Windows legacy systems, makes it clear how real the threat is for healthcare leaders.

Despite the well-known cyberthreats, communicating these risks to senior leaders and boards can be challenging, according to Deloitte's research report based on interviews with chief information officers (CIOs), chief security information officers (CISOs) and C-suite executives from biopharma companies, medical device manufacturers, health plans and health systems.
