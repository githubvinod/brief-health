Are we living in Minority Report? If we are, whose fault is that? I’m recovering from the hyperventilating hyperbole in the reportage of IBM’s labeling of a dataset of facial photographs and making it available to researchers to reduce bias in facial recognition. NBC News went with a headline that read: Facial recognition’s ‘dirty little secret’: Millions of online photos scraped without consent. That might merit a “pants on fire” rating if it were in the realm of political reporting. The photos were not “scraped.” They were licensed.
