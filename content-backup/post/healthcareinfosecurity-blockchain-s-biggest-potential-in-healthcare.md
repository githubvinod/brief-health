Where is the greatest potential for the implementation of blockchain in healthcare?”What we’re seeing in terms of real applications – outside the whole morass of cryptocurrency types of offerings – are auditing and portability capabilities that make it easier for … patients to access and hold onto their most current records without carrying around a file cabinet,” says attorney Steven Teppler of the law firm Mandelbaum Salsburg.And for organizations that handle and manage health records, blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, offers “an easier way to facilitate both the generation, the transmission, and the security of the records,” Teppler says in an interview with Information Security Media Group.
