title: Artificial Intelligence in the ICU
---
The paucity of positive multicentre prospective randomised control trials in ICU settings serves to highlight the challenge of running studies in such environments, where multiple treatments are given simultaneously to individuals who respond in variable ways based on their individual physiology. Consequently, without established guidelines, ICU clinician decision-making is driven largely by experience and instinct, resulting in significant variability amongst clinicians. Artificial intelligence (AI), which is now increasingly used in healthcare, has the potential to reduce this inter-clinician variability and offer other benefits. AIâ€™s notable advantage is its ability to find complex relationships in large volumes of data, as well as to analyse many variables to predict outcomes of interest, such as sepsis or mortality. There are many potential applications for AI in the intensive care unit (ICU), particularly given the large amounts of data collected routinely. However, there are some important considerations for ensuring successful implementation.
