Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen driving what is regarded as the new phase of automation. Advocates say it is hard to think of any area of our lives that will not be affected by this nascent data driven technology. AI is already in healthcare too; for example, Google’s Deep Mind has taught machines to read retinal scans with at least as much accuracy as an experienced junior doctor. Meanwhile, a new project funded by the British Heart Foundation aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting people’s risk of heart attack based on their health records.
