Considering national healthcare spending is projected to increase by 5.5% per year from 2017 to 2026, security and efficiency are more important than ever for todayâ€™s hospitals. Existing healthcare payment processing solutions are often outdated, cumbersome and need to be revamped to reduce costs and provide better patient experiences.

Some of the main areas that need to be addressed are using a modern payment system to ensure payment card industry (PCI) and HIPAA compliance, providing creative payment plans, and centralizing reporting information and analytics. In this guest post, Drew Sementa, CEO of a merchant solutions and payment processing company, will show how each of these can be improved with merchant services software.
